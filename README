This is a simple plugin that creates a scratch buffer for your
vim session and helps to access it when you need it.  
                                                                 
If you like the custom mapping provided in the script - hitting
<F8> should create a new scratch buffer. You can do your scribes
here and if you want to get rid of it, hit <F8> again. If you want to 
get back to the scratch buffer hit <F8> again.
